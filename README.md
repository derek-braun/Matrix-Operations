Implementing several common matrix operations as java functions. The primary intention is for these operations to be used for application in single and multivariate linear regression.

The matrix operations implemented in this example include:

- mxn matrix addition
- mxn matrix multiplication
- matrix and vector multiplication
- inversion
- transpose
- Identity matrix creation
