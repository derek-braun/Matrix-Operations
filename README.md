# Multivariate-Linear-Regression-Tools

This project is designed as an example implementation of several common linear regression techniques, building many of the related tools from scratch. Although the project is intended as an example implemenation, many of the methods and structures created can be used reuesed as needed in a more template-like manner.

Matrix Operations Class:

Implementing several common matrix operations as java functions. The primary intention is for these operations to be used for application in single and multivariate linear regression.

The matrix operations supported in this example include:

- mxn matrix addition
- mxn matrix multiplication
- matrix and vector multiplication
- inversion
- transpose
- Identity matrix creation

Regression Tools Class:

Utilizing the associated matrix operations class to provide simple implementation of several common equations and processes for linear regression as a set of intuitive methods. Many methods implement helper functions for reusable equation implementation. 

The regression tools supported in this example include:

- Feature Scaling
- Normal Equation

- Associated Helper Functions:
  - Standard Deviation
  - Mean Calculations
